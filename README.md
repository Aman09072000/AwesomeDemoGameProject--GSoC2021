## Awesome Demo Game Project
![MainPagea](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64133045/129755079-78b63379-1f19-45fd-8112-4750fe0efe3a.jpg)

An Awesome Tutorial Game ( playable on both phones as well as on smart TV when cast ) in Catrobat Visual Programming Language. The game is inspired by a hugely popular 2D game “Hollow Knight”. The main character of the game is Batro who is the king of the Batona kingdom. At each level, king Batro fights with one of the evil monsters and crosses the hurdles and In the last level, the king fights with Giant Monster Martian and frees his Kingdom from the evil Monsters. The player follows Batro in his journey. The game story is easily depicted through cinematic cutscenes for better insight. The game is very easy to play and get into, with on-screen controls, and a fairly simple UI. The game is playable on both phones and on a smart TV without looking at the phone's screen while using the phone as a gamepad. This game shows how the ‘Pocket Code’ app can be used to develop high-quality video games if used efficiently and effectively.

## About Game
King Of Batona is basically a classically styled 2D action-adventure game across a vast interconnected world just like the Hollow Knight game. The game will have 3 different levels. In Every level you will cross the hurdles and fight with the monster of that level. In each level you get a special power which will help in defeating the giant monster at last level. 
### Game Story-
Batona Is a kingdom of great warriors. The king of that kingdom is Batro. He is a master of various weapons and fighting styles. He is also a music lover and peace lover king. his people are always very happy with his work. In one evil night the father of darkness and king of monsters Martian attacked in Batro Kingdom and destroyed it. Batro decides to fight for his kingdom and for his people.
The complete game is revolving around this story. In each level king Batro fights with one of the evil monsters and crosses the hurdles and In the last level king fights with giant monster Martian and frees his kingdom from the evil monsters.
The main character of the game is Batro, he is heavily inspired by the logo of Catrobat. The player follows Batro in his journey.The game-story is easily depicted through cinematic cutscenes for better insight. The game is very easy to play and get into, with on-screen controls, and a fairly simple UI. This game shows how the ‘Pocket Code’ app can be used to develop high-quality video games, if used efficiently and effectively.

## Complete Plan
After going through the idealist of the catrobat community thoroughly I found “Awesome Demo Game” project suitable to my skill set and interest. I have always been fascinated and impacted by games that are not just about gameplay, but that carry a whole universe.Pocket Code provides the perfect tools to express my ideas and with the help of it, ​I  want to showcase how the Pocket Code and Luna&Cat IDE apps could be used to create big game-projects like- “Hollow Knight".
Pocket Code has functionalities like storing the data locally on a device. There are various sensors like accelerometer and multi-touch which are used in the game to showcase the potential of Pocket Code. My plan is to design and develop an awesome tutorial game in Catrobat Visual Programming Language using the Luna&Cat IDE app. 
This game is playable on both phones as well as on smart TV when cast.I Means we can use the phone as a gamepad, and the TV for playing. and  use multi-touch, phone's sensors, magnetic fields, acceleration, vibration and other features of pocket code as well.

### Contributing to the Project
The project files (.catrobat files) created during this summer are in the ‘Projects’ folder inside the drive link. All the project files, along with the amount of content they hold, are in the “Project Summaries” document in the directory. The(.catrobat) file can be imported into your Pocket Code app.
Download the desired project file and remix it as you want!
